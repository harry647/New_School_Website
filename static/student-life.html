                The House System at Bar Union Mixed Secondary School is an integral part of student life, designed
                to promote unity, healthy competition, and a strong sense of belonging. From the moment students
                join the school, they are welcomed into one of our four vibrant houses—each with its own unique
                identity, colors, values, and spirit.
                <br><br>
                The houses serve as platforms for leadership development, academic motivation, co-curricular engagement,
                and character building. Inter-house activities—ranging from sports and debates to academics, arts,
                and community service—encourage teamwork, personal growth, responsibility, and resilience.
                <br><br>
                Through mentorship from house patrons and collaboration with peers, students learn discipline,
                cooperation, confidence, and fair play. The strong bond within houses helps nurture positive values
                and lifelong friendships, shaping learners into responsible and well-rounded individuals.
