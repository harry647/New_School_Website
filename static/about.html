                        <p>
                            Bar Union Mixed Secondary School derived its name from "Bar," a Luo word meaning 'a region with plenty of grass and scattered trees.'
                            The school was established in <strong>1983</strong> and provisionally registered as a one-day school in 1984 as a union of three churches —
                            Anglican Church of Kenya, African Inland Church, and Seventh Day Adventist — under the stewardship of their church elders,
                            Mr. Daniel Ollo, Mr. Jacob Otiende, and Mr. Ibrahim Ahoya.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The school was named <strong>Bar Union Mixed Secondary School</strong> to reflect its founding churches and its scenic location amidst
                            abundant grass and scattered trees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since its inception, the school has undergone significant transformations in infrastructure, enrollment, staff establishment,
                            and management support. Starting as a single-streamed school in 1984, it became fully registered as a two-streamed school in 2001
                            with 320 students. By 2010, enrollment increased to 480 students, prompting registration as a four-streamed school. Currently,
                            the school serves <strong>953 students</strong>, projected to reach approximately 1000+ by 2026.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leadership has been overseen by seven principals: Mr. Peter Ochuka (1983–1986), Mr. Ochieng Ogony (1987–1990), Mr. Aoro Ochieng (1991–1992),
                            Mr. Malak Akolo (1993–2003), Mrs. Roselyne Ochieng (2003–2009), Mrs. Betty A. Oyuga (2010–2023) and Mr. George Achilla (2023-Present).
