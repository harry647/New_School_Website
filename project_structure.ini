## Chapter One: Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Strategic Plan
The main purpose of this plan is to provide a structured roadmap for the realization of the school's vision of "being a model school" while focusing on its mission of "moulding holistic citizens for self and national development."

#### 1.2 Rationale for Strategic Plan

- Is a statutory requirement in today's management for conducting performance appraisal for school managers.
- Provides basis for implementers and curriculum implementers.
- Provides basis for resource mobilization and allocation (i.e., budgeting).
- Ensures efficiency and effectiveness in management.
- Ensures criteria for prioritizing school needs.
- Provides for school and involvement.
- Ensures stakeholder participation/landmarks in the growth and development of the school.
- Outlines the key milestone/landmarks in the growth and development of the school.
- Helps to avoid duplication.
- Provides framework for planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating school programs.

### 1.3 Background Information

#### 1.3.1 Historical Background
Bar Union Mixed Secondary School derived its name from "Bar" a Luo word which means 'a region with plenty of grass and scattered trees.' The school was established in 1983 and provisionally registered as a one day school in 1984 as 'a union' of three churches namely Anglican Church of Kenya, African Inland Church and Seventh Day Adventist under the stewardship of their church elders Mr. Daniel Ollo, Mr. Jacob Otiende and Mr. Ibrahim Ahoya respectively.

Because the school was created out of the union of the churches and placed with plenty of grass and scattered trees, it was named BAR UNION Mixed Secondary School.

The school has since undergone several transformations in infrastructure, enrollment, staff establishment, and management support and resource capacity. From a provisionally registered single streamed school in 1984, the school was officially fully registered as two-streamed school in 2001 with 320 students. A few years later, the student enrollment had escalated which saw the school registered as a four-streamed school in 2010 with a population of 480 students. This has also changed and the school currently boasts of a blossoming student population of 615 students which is projected to hit approximately 800 students by 2021.

From its inception to date, the school has been managed by six principals at different times. The first principal to run the school was Mr. Peter Ochuka who reigned between 1983 and 1986. Mr. Ochieng Ogony took over from 1987 to 1990 before he was changed with Mr.Aoro Ochieng from 1991 to 1992. Mr. Malak Akolo took slightly longer and managed the school from 1993 to 2003. Between 2003 and 2009, the school was managed by Mrs. Roselyne Ochieng until Mrs. Betty A. Oyuga took over the management of the school from 2010 to date.

##### 1.3.2.2 Catchment Area

##### 1.3.2.3 Population
Currently, the school has a student enrollment of 615 students (341 boys and 274 girls) spread across 4-streams and is projected to increase to approximately 800 students by 2021. The whole student population is spread across 4 streams namely East, West, South and North. Only Form One has operationalized the fourth stream (West) meaning the school has a total of one day classrooms. The fourth stream is urgently required in form Two and Three by 2019, 2020, a fourth stream will be required in form 4, The school will therefore become full-fledged four streamed school by 2021.This means re-registering the school to 5- fledged four steamed school by 2021.This means re-registering the school to 5- stream will be eminent by 2022. The process should be underway by 2021.

The school has a total of 28 teachers (16 TSC and 12 BOM) of whom 18 are males and 10 are females against Curriculum Establishment of 38 teachers. Support staff population is 10 (6 males, 4 females).

##### 1.3.2.4 Core-Curriculum

Subjects taught and examined in the school are: Mathematics, English, Kiswahili, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Geography, History, C.R.E, Agriculture and Business Studies and Home science.

##### 1.3.3 Leadership, Governance and Student Representation
Students conduct elections every academic year to elect their Student Governing Council headed by two School Captains (Head Boy and Head Girl) and Deputy School Captain. For these senior most positions, there is guided democracy where leaders are elected under the auspices of the school senior Management Committee. The student leaders link the students with management bodies and ensure that the school rules and regulations are adhered to.

The school is managed by a team of competent and visionary Board of Management chaired by Mr. George Ominde. The Board is usually subdivided into various committees to handle specific aspects of school management. The principal is the secretary to the Board of management and executes most of the policy decisions for and on behalf of the Board. The board is constituted in conformity with the Education Act (a third of the total membership is of female gender, 3 representatives are from the community, 4 representatives from the sponsoring church and 3 representatives from special interest groups). The Parents chaired by Mr. Charles Oswago forms the executive arm of Board of Management and supports the policy decisions for and on behalf of the Board.

There have been encumbrances in school attendance, language policy, students' rights and conflicts. The school however embraces dialogue, G&C and alternate dispute resolution strategies in dealing with students and staff discipline.

Key sources of finance for successful implementation of the plan shall include: Direct school fee, Constituency Development Fund (CDF), Government Infrastructure Grants, Free secondary Education, well-wishers and donors. Deficits in the funding may be supplemented through IGAs, budget cuts and fundraising.

### 1.7 Limitations of the 2015-2019 School Strategic Plan
Objective critique of the previous strategic plan reveal that the plan had several limitations: some of these include the following:
1. There is apparent lack of focus on strategic direction. In the plan, there was only mild mention of d -sired strategic goal but without clearly articulating strategies for achieving th goal. In any case, for a school set up, this particular goal should be augmented with other support goals for completeness. The goal stated is clearly a curriculum goal which requires more than the above stated strategies to achieve. It may be enough to
